# Teal Theme

## Fork of [Nice Teal Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evanwebdev.nice-teal-theme), meant as an improvement

### Changes from the original

- Diff editor text colors are more visible, and transparent so that text selections can be seen. Borders / outlines were also removed to fix pixel density issues causing text to look as if it's shifted around and/or misplaced.
- Text selections are now transparent... Just in case.

Most teal themes are very bright, and as a result, it's not good for the eyes. That's where this theme comes in. It brings in the feel of teal into VS Code, while also making your eyes happy with it.

Below are some screenshots of the theme:
